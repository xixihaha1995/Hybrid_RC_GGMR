	abstract = {Lower costs and improved performance of sensors, controllers, and networking is leading to the development of smart building features, such as continuous performance monitoring, automated diagnostics, and optimal supervisory control. For some of these applications, it is important to be able to predict transient cooling and heating requirements for the building using inverse models that are trained using on-site data. Existing inverse models for transient building loads range from purely empirical or “black-box” models to purely physical or “white-box” models. Generally, black-box (e.g., neural network) models require a significant amount of training data and may not always reflect the actual physical behavior, whereas white-box (e.g., finite difference) models require specification of many physical parameters. This paper presents a hybrid or “gray-box” modeling approach that uses a transfer function with parameters that are constrained to satisfy a simple physical representation for energy flows in the building structure. A robust method is also presented for training parameters of the constrained model, wherein initial values of and bounds on physical parameters are estimated from a rough building description, better estimates are obtained using a global direct search algorithm, and optimal parameters are identified using a nonlinear regression algorithm. The model and training method were extensively tested for different buildings and locations using data generated from a detailed simulation program. The approach was also tested using data from a field site located near Chicago, Illinois. It was found that one to two weeks of data are sufficient to train a model so that it can accurately predict transient cooling or heating requirements.},

It makes use of individual and group memory to update each particle position allowing global as well as local search optimization.

Furthermore, it was shown that the PSO search strategy can be represented as a discrete-dynamic system which converges to an equilibrium point. From a stability analysis of such system, a parameter selection heuristic was developed which provides an initial guideline to the selection of the different PSO setting parameters. Experimentally, it was found that using the derived heuristics with a slightly larger cognitive pressure value},

A population of individuals, which encode the problem solutions are manipulated according to the rule of survival of the fittest through "genetic" operations, such as mutation, crossover and reproduction. A best solution is evolved through the generations. In contrast to evolutionary computation techniques, Eberhart and Kennedy developed a different algorithm through simulating social behavior (R.C. Eberhart et al., 1996; R.C. Eberhart and J. Kennedy, 1996; J. Kennedy and R.C. Eberhart, 1995; J. Kennedy, 1997). As in other algorithms, a population of individuals exists. This algorithm is called particle swarm optimization (PSO) since it resembles a school of flying birds. In a particle swarm optimizer, instead of using genetic operators, these individuals are "evolved" by cooperation and competition among the individuals themselves through generations. Each particle adjusts its flying according to its own flying experience and its companions' flying experience. We introduce a new parameter, called inertia weight, into the original particle swarm optimizer. Simulations have been done to illustrate the significant and effective impact of this new parameter on the particle swarm optimizer.},

Data-driven approach and first-principle approach are two commonly used methods in developing models for predicting building energy use. In this paper, several data-driven methods including multiple linear regression, adaptive linear filter algorithms (least mean square (LMS), normalized least mean square (nLMS), and recursive least square (RLS)), and Gaussian mixture model regression (GMMR) are employed to predict hourly energy usages in two buildings. One building is a synthetic large-size office building from DOE reference building models. The hourly building energy consumption was predicted using the energy simulation model for one year under Chicago climate. The other building is an existing office building located in Des Moines, Iowa. The actual hourly building energy consumption of the existing building was obtained through building submeters. The accuracies of these data-driven models for predicting energy usages of the two buildings are compared. The GMMR models outperform the adaptive filter methods in this study. Both the GMMR and adaptive filter methods meet the model calibration criteria defined by the ASHRAE Guideline 14.},

The challenge is developing an automatic fault detection and diagnosis algorithm for monitoring of multi-mode nonlinear systems. This paper proposes a novel adaptive Gaussian mixture model (AGMM) approach for automatic fault detection and diagnosis in nonlinear systems. The concept of this method relies on developing a time-varying probabilistic machine-learning model for non-linear systems. In this study, Gaussian mixture model regression (GMMR) technique is used to model a nonlinear system based on measurement data. Unscented Kalman filter (UKF) is then integrated with GMMR for adjusting the model parameters based on the feedback of residuals between observation and model prediction. The proposed algorithm is able to detect and diagnose simultaneous faults in systems from monitoring variations of key GMMR parameters. The application of AGMM method is demonstrated for detection and diagnosis of common faults in a water-cooled multi-chiller plant system. Faults including energy efficiency degradation in chillers were tested with the proposed method. Results indicate that the AGMM approach is successful in detection and diagnosis of simultaneous faults.},

Both a simplified star-network as well as a triangular network has been used. While the star-network is less complex than the triangular network it can only be used for a restricted type of construction such as activated concrete slabs. The triangular network can be used both for surface radiant systems such as floor heating and ceiling cooling as well as for concrete core conditioning. The triangular RC-network therefore can cover a wide range of application but since it is more complicated to optimize it will require a more complex pre-processor to build and optimize the RC-network if placed in a simulation environment.},

	abstract = {This paper is concerned with the thermal models which can physically reflect the heat-flow paths in a lightweight three-phase half-bridge two-level SiC power module with six MOSFETs and can be used for coupled electrothermal simulation. The finite-element (FE) model was first evaluated and calibrated to provide the raw data for establishing the physical resistor-capacitor (RC) network model. It was experimentally verified that the cooling condition of the module mounted on a water cooler can be satisfactorily described by assuming the water cooler as a heat exchange boundary in the FE model. The compact RC network consisting of 115 R and C parameters to predict the transient junction temperatures of the six MOSFETS was constructed, where cross-heating effects between the MOSFETs are represented with lateral thermal resistors. A three-step curve fitting method was especially developed to overcome the challenge for extracting the R and C values of the RC network from the selected FE simulation results. The established compact RC network model can physically be correlated with the structure and heat-flow paths in the power module, and was evaluated using the FE simulation results from the power module under realistic switching conditions. It was also integrated into the LTspice model to perform the coupled electrothermal simulation to predict the power losses and junction temperatures of the six MOSFETs under switching frequencies from 5 to 100 kHz which demonstrate the good electrothermal performance of the designed power module.},

Previous analytical adjustment methods can be complex and inaccurate, while optimization algorithms, although more accurate, require prior simulation using a high-order reference model, and so provide no advantages to be integrated into simulation programs. This work presents a methodology for the analytical adjustment of a first-order model based on the hypothesis that the position of the capacitance varies in every time step in response to changes in the excitation value. By comparison with a reference model and using a wide range of constructions (420), the functional form of this dependence was determined in accordance with the value of time step and properties and thickness of the element. Using different typical constructions (41), the method was validated by comparison with the reference model in terms of surface heat fluxes, surface temperatures and indoor air temperature. The results showed an excellent agreement with the reference model for surface temperatures and indoor air temperature, and good agreement for surface heat fluxes. The method can be integrated into simulation programs with a low computational cost, sufficient accuracy, universality and adaptable time step.},

In this paper, building models are considered from two perspectives – simulation and optimisation. First, a methodology is devised for the development of complex simulation models for control strategy comparison and analysis. A novel spatio-temporal filtering technique for estimation of disturbances is devised and combined with metaheuristic search methods to allow for models to be derived from data in which typical disturbances are present. Adapting the disturbance estimation techniques, methods are then proposed for deriving low-order models from data, suitable for use within an optimisation-based MPC strategy. The modelling concepts are implemented using data from a real building and a potential MPC formulation is assessed.},

	abstract = {Constructing a model of thermal dynamics of a multi-zone building requires modeling heat conduction through walls as well as convection due to air-flows among the zones. Reduced order models of conduction in terms of RC-networks are well established, while currently the only way to model convection is through CFD (Computational Fluid Dynamics). This limits convection models to a single zone or a small number of zones in a building. In this paper we present a novel method of identifying a reduced order thermal model of a multi-zone building from measured space temperature data. The method consists of first identifying the underlying network structure, in particular, the paths of convective interaction among zones, which corresponds to edges of a building graph. Convective interaction among a pair of zones is modeled as a RC network, in a manner analogous to conduction models. The second step of the proposed method involves estimating the parameters of the RC network model for the convection edges. The identified convection edges, along with the associated R and C values, are used to augment a thermal dynamics model of a building that is originally constructed to model only conduction. Predictions by the augmented model and the conduction-only model are compared with space temperatures measured in a multi-zone building in the University of Florida campus. The identified model is seen to predict the temperatures more accurately than a conduction-only model.},

In this work, the regression problem for multivariate systems is solved by implementing an efﬁcient probabilistic incremental algorithm. It allows learning high-dimensional redundant non-linear maps by the cumulative acquisition of data from input-output systems. The proposed model is aimed at solving prediction and inference problems. The implementation introduced in this work allows learning from data batches without the need of keeping them in memory afterwards. The learning architecture is built using Incremental Gaussian Mixture Models. The Expectation-Maximization algorithm and general geometric properties of Gaussian distributions are used to train the models. Our current implementation can produce accurate results ﬁtting models in real multivariate systems. Results are shown from testing the algorithm for both situations, one where the incremental learning is demonstrated and the second where the performance to solve the regression problem is evaluated on a toy example.},

	abstract = {Data-driven soft sensor approach has been widely applied on real-time prediction and control of difficult-to-measure quality variables. Among these approaches, the Gaussian mixture regression (GMR) carries the potential of dealing with nonlinear and non-Gaussian industry problems, which has drawn increasing popularity and attentions in recent years. However, the fluctuation of raw materials, change of process environment, aging of instruments and other factors will have an effect on system performances over time. Hence, the lack of adaptive mechanism will make the GMR difficult to suit for time-varying processes and may cause large prediction errors. In order to model time-varying industrial processes and improve the adaptability of the conventional GMR, an adaptive soft sensor based on incremental Gaussian mixture regression (IGMR) is proposed in this paper. The incremental idea is integrated and an adaptive mechanism is added, which endow the proposed IGMR with the capability of adapting to new data in online environment. Compared to the moving window GMR (MWGMR) and the just-in-time learning GMR (JITLGMR), the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed IGMR are verified both in a numerical simulation and a real-life industrial process experiment.},

Simplified yet accurate heat transfer models are essential for energy simulation of this system. This study presents the development and validation of a simplified RC-network model for the pipe-embedded concrete radiant floors. A concrete radiant floor mainly consists of three parts which are the cover layer, the pipe-embedded concrete slab and the insulation layer. The cover layer and the insulation layer are simplified as one-dimensional and represented by RC models with two resistances and one capacitance (2R1C). Within the pipe-embedded concrete slab, the complex heat transfer is represented by a coupled RC model which includes two parts describing the heat transfers of the concrete slab and the water loop respectively. In the case studies, the coupled RC model for the pipe-embedded concrete slab has been validated in both numerical and experimental ways. The experimental validation results show that the average relative errors of the coupled RC model in predicting the upper and bottom surface heat fluxes are all less than 5.5\%. Validation has also been conducted to demonstrate the accuracy and effectiveness of this developed simplified RC-network model in predicting the dynamic thermal performance of a multi-layer pipe-embedded concrete radiant floor. The developed simplified RC-network model can be beneficial for design and optimal control of the pipe-embedded concrete radiant floor system.},

The choice of GMR is motivated by two key advantages (1) the number of unique operational patterns of a building can be identified using an information-theoretic criteria in a data-driven manner and (2) confidence bounds on baseline prediction are localized and their estimation is integrated with the modeling process itself. The proposed GMR approach is applied to two cases (1) one year synthetic data set generated by Department of Energy (DoE) reference model for a supermarket in Chicago climate and (2) one year field data for a retail store building located in California. The results from GMR model are compared with some prevalent multivariate regression models for baseline building energy use.},

	abstract = {Gaussian Mixture Regression has been shown to be a powerful and easy-to-tune regression technique for imitation learning of constrained motor tasks in robots. Yet, current formulations are not suited when one wants a robot to learn incrementally and online a variety of new context-dependant tasks whose number and complexity is not known at programming time, and when the demonstrator is not allowed to tell the system when he introduces a new task (but rather the system should infer this from the continuous sensorimotor context). In this paper, we show that this limitation can be addressed by introducing an Incremental, Local and Online variation of Gaussian Mixture Regression (ILO-GMR) which successfully allows a simulated robot to learn incrementally and online new motor tasks through modelling them locally as dynamical systems, and able to use the sensorimotor context to cope with the absence of categorical information both during demonstrations and when a reproduction is asked to the system. Moreover, we integrate a complementary statistical technique which allows the system to incrementally learn various tasks which can be intrinsically defined in different frames of reference, which we call framings, without the need to tell the system which particular framing should be used for each task: this is inferred automatically by the system.},

	abstract = {Urban energy management nowadays has put more focus on residential houses energy consumption. Lots of machine learning based data-driven approaches have the abilities to characterize and forecast total energy consumption of commercial data. However, a paucity of research applying data-driven methods have been tested on the hour ahead energy consumption forecast for typical single family houses in the US. With the advances in smart metering, sub meter usages forecast in household-level is also getting more and more popular on smart building control and demand response program. The situation here inspires us to develop a hybrid model to address the problem of residential hour and day ahead load forecasting through the integration of data-driven techniques with a physics-based model. In this article, we report on the evaluations of five different machine learning algorithms, artificial neural network (ANN), support vector regression (SVR), least-square support vector machine (LS-SVM), Gaussian process regression (GPR) and Gaussian mixture model (GMM), applied to four residential data set that contains smart meters. Both total and non-air conditioning (AC) power consumption are forecasted for hour ahead and 24-h ahead. The variation of patterns captured from non-AC part is further input as internal heat gain to a physics-based model. The model uses a 2R-1C thermal network and an AC regression model. By utilizing this hybrid approach, we get AC load prediction and non-AC energy forecast simultaneously. Total energy consumption is further produced by summing up the two sub meters forecast for hybrid model. The results from new modeling are compared with those from pure data-driven techniques. The final result showing improvements of coefficient of variance between the best data-driven model and hybrid model are 6–10\% and 2–15\% for hour ahead and 24-h ahead, respectively.},

A recently constructed 17,500m2 building with a multi-floor radiant slab cooling system in the tower was investigated through simulation calibrated with measured building energy use and meteorological data. For the very cold, dry region where the building was located, it was found that a typical floor of the tower would have had 30\% lower annual energy use with a conventional variable air volume system than with the as-built radiant cooling-variable air volume combination. This was due to (1) simultaneous heating and cooling by the existing radiant cooling and air systems, (2) the large amount of free cooling possible in this climate, and (3) suboptimal control settings. If these issues were remedied and combined with improved envelope and a dedicated outdoor air system with exhaust air heat recovery, a typical floor could achieve annual energy use 80\% lower than a typical floor of the existing building HVAC system. This shows that radiant thermal control can make a significant contribution to energy-efficiency, but only if the building design and operating practices complement the strengths of the radiant system.},

	abstract = {In Europe, hydronic concrete core systems are being increasingly used for room conditioning systems. The concrete slab acts as heat accumulator and permits dissipation of the load using, for instance, cooling towers. When using such systems the external climatic conditions limit the achievable water temperature. The convective loads, however, directly affect the room air temperature and reduce the storable part of the load. The ventilation system also has a large influence on the energy related operation of such a system. Moreover, the dimensions of the concrete slab and the layout geometry of the water pipes, especially the spacing, are important factors for the design of the system. A model is described which can be used to illustrate the transient two dimensional heat flow in such a construction. This method is suitable for simple hand calculations, but can also be integrated into existing building simulation programs without having to modify the program code. Thus, the complete system can be designed for practical applications to ensure optimum operation. In addition, this paper describes the interrelationship between heat storage capacity and pipe geometry. Finally, criteria are listed for suitable application of concrete slab cooling and further aspects are listed that need to be considered in connection with these systems.},

Our MPC approach uses dynamic estimates and predictions of zone loads and temperatures, outdoor weather conditions, and HVAC system models to minimize energy consumption and cost while meeting equipment and thermal comfort constraints. It includes data-driven building models estimated and validated using data from an actual building, and deploys an optimizer based on constraint linear/quadratic programming with hard comfort bounds that yields a global minimum with predicted exogenous disturbances. The MPC results show 34\% cost savings compared to baseline feedback control during the cooling season and 16\% energy use reduction during the heating season. Also, the radiant floor system with the predictive controller shows 29–50\% energy savings when compared with a baseline air delivery system serving two identical thermal zones located in the same building.},

This study conducted a literature review on the basic and applied research in RHC systems for the built environment. The objective of this review is to find out the research trend of the RHC system, to discover main issues for the RHC system understanding, and to suggest further studies for the system development. In this study, a comprehensive review was conducted, in terms of thermal comfort, thermal analysis including heat transfer model, heating/cooling capacity, CFD analysis, energy simulation, system configuration and control strategies. The results showed that the RHC system has been continuously developed, modified and improved to achieve better thermal comfort and energy efficiency.

This number is steadily increasing, posing a challenge to energy regulators as well as suppliers. To manage the growing demand for energy, there is a need for energy system optimization, especially on the demand side. This paper uses a first principles approach to build a high-resolution energy demand model, which can be used as a test bed by academicians as well as policy makers for performing such optimizations. This framework generates activity-based, building-level, time-dependent demand profiles. The model associates appliance usage with each household activity and calculates energy consumption based on the appliance energy rating, the duration of the energy consuming activity, and the type of activity performed by each household member. It also accounts for shared activities among household members to avoid double counting. Additionally, passive energy consumptions such as space heating/cooling, lighting, etc., are measured. Finally, validation of the results obtained by this model against real-world data for Virginia is carried out. The results indicate that the modeling framework is robust and can be extended to other parts of the U.S. and beyond.},

Additionally, a detailed physical simulation model based on the Finite-Element-Method is developed and validated with measured data. A verification of the new RC-model and the FEM-model is carried out. The mean deviation of the outlet fluid temperature between both models is 0.62 K. The mean deviation of the PCM-temperature is 0.85 K.

	abstract = {Energy modeling approaches have continued to advance to cater for emerging new design concepts toward “greener” solutions that optimize energy consumption in buildings while maintaining thermal comfort as well as healthy environment. Increasing attention is given to passive and mix-mode systems in building. Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) model has been widely adopted as effective tool for natural ventilation simulations. However, CFD become unstable for conjugate heat transfer model, which is the transient heat transfer between solid and fluid. Solid and fluid has different respond times to thermal energy. Typically walls respond in hours, and air responds in seconds, causing the system to become stiff. In addressing the issue, a coupled lumped heat transfer model (EnergyPlus) and CFD model (Fluent) was implemented, and 8 days of simulation was conducted. The airflow rates of openings and heat transfer coefficients from the airflow network module in EnergyPlus and those from CFD model were compared. Results show that airflow network model generally predict smaller airflow rates for the openings. Airflow network model generates better results for openings on the south and east facade and internal openings, where there is no immediate adjacent building. Among the heat transfer coefficients calculation methods in EnergyPlus, the TARP algorithm generated closest HTC values to the coupled CFD results. The overall heat transfer coefficients of all the enclosure surfaces are calculated and it is found that the overall thermal resistances generated from the three convective HTC algorithms are almost the same, yet with observable difference from coupled CFD simulations.},

EnergyPlus includes a number of innovative simulation features — such as variable time steps, user-configurable modular systems that are integrated with a heat and mass balance-based zone simulation — and input and output data structures tailored to facilitate third party module and interface development. Other planned simulation capabilities include multizone airflow, and electric power and solar thermal and photovoltaic simulation.

	abstract = {One major obstacle in Heating, Ventilation and Air Conditioning (HVAC) system Fault Detection and Diagnostics (FDD), retrofitting and energy performance evaluation is the lack of detailed hourly cooling load data. Cooling load measurement in commercial buildings is expensive and sometimes very difficult to implement. Detailed building simulation models, such as EnergyPlus, are too complicated to build and also must be calibrated. In this paper, an hourly cooling load prediction model, called the “RC-S” model, is proposed. This new cooling load calculation approach consists of a simplified thermal network model of the building envelope, a thermal network model for the building internal mass and the internal cooling load model from the submetering system. One existing RC model is introduced as reference model and three types of “RC-S” models are set up in this study. Genetic algorithm (GA) is selected to optimize the parameters in those models. Measurement data collected from a real commercial building and simulation data obtained from EnergyPlus model of the same commercial building are used to train and test the four models. The results prove that the proposed “RC-S” cooling load calculation method is more accurate than the existing RC model and much simpler than whole building simulation models. It can provide reasonable estimations of cooling loads for HVAC FDD and other performance evaluations.},

	abstract = {Robot programming by demonstration (PbD) has become a central topic of robotics that spans across general research areas such as human-robot interaction, machine learning, machine vision and motor control. Robot PbD started about 30 years ago, and has grown importantly during the past decade. The rationale for moving from purely preprogrammed robots to very flexible user-based interfaces for training robots to perform a task is three-fold. First and foremost, PbD, also referred to as imitation learning, is a powerful mechanism for reducing the complexity of search spaces for learning. When observing either good or bad examples, one can reduce the search for a possible solution, by either starting the search from the observed good solution (local optima), or conversely, by eliminating from the search space what is known as a bad solution. Imitation learning is, thus, a powerful tool for enhancing and accelerating learning in both animals and artifacts. Second, imitation learning offers an implicit means of training a machine, such that explicit and tedious programming of a task by a human user can be minimized or eliminated (Fig. 59.1). Imitation learning is thus a natural means of interacting with a machine that would be accessible to lay people. Open image in new window Fig. 59.1 Left: A robot learns how to make a chess move (namely moving the queen forward) by generalizing across different demonstrations of the task performed in slightly different situations (different starting positions of the hand). The robot records its jointsʼ trajectories and learns to extract what-to-imitate, i.e. that the task constraints are reduced to a subpart of the motion located in a plane defined by the three chess pieces. Right: The robot reproduces the skill in a new context (for different initial position of the chess piece) by finding an appropriate controller that satisfies both the task constraints and constraints relative to its body limitation (how-to-imitate problem), adapted from [59.1] Third, studying and modeling the coupling of perception and action, which is at the core of imitation learning, helps us to understand the mechanisms by which the self-organization of perception and action could arise during development. The reciprocal interaction of perception and action could explain how competence in motor control can be grounded in rich structure of perceptual variables, and vice versa, how the processes of perception can develop as means to create successful actions. PbD promises were thus multiple. On the one hand, one hoped that it would make learning faster, in contrast to tedious reinforcement learning methods or trials-and-error learning. On the other hand, one expected that the methods, being user-friendly, would enhance the application of robots in human daily environments. Recent progresses in the field, which we review in this chapter, show that the field has made a leap forward during the past decade toward these goals. In addition, we anticipate that these promises may be fulfilled very soon. Section 59.1 presents a brief historical overview of robot Programming by Demonstration (PbD), introducing several issues that will be discussed later in this chapter. Section 59.2 reviews engineering approaches to robot PbD with an emphasis on machine learning approaches that provide the robot with the ability to adapt the learned skill to different situations (Sect. 59.2.1). This section discusses also the different types of representation that one may use to encode a skill and presents incremental learning techniques to refine the skill progressively (Sect. 59.2.4). Section 59.2.3 emphasizes the importance to give the teacher an active role during learning and presents different ways in which the user can convey cues to the robot to help it to improve its learning. Section 59.2.4 discusses how PbD can be jointly used with other learning strategies to overcome some limitations of PbD. Section 59.3 reviews works that take a more biological approach to robot PbD and develops models of either the cognitive or neural processes of imitation learning in primates. Finally, Sect. 59.4 lists various open issues in robot PbD that have yet been little explored by the field.},

	abstract = {The sparsity of high dimensional data space renders standard nonparametric methods ineffective for multivariate data. A new procedure, Gaussian Mixture Regression (GMR), is developed for multivariate nonlinear regression modeling. GMR has the tight structure of a parametric model, yet still retains the flexibility of a nonparametric method.
The key idea of GMR is to construct a sequence of Gaussian mixture models for the joint density of the data, and then derive conditional density and regression functions from each model. Assuming the data are a random sample from the joint pdf fX,Y, we fit a Gaussian kernel density model fˆX,Y and then implement a multivariate extension of the Iterative Pairwise Replacement Algorithm (IPRA) to simplify the initial kernel density. IPRA generates a sequence of Gaussian mixture density models indexed by the number of mixture components K. The corresponding regression function of each density model forms a sequence of regression models which covers a spectrum of regression models of varying flexibility, ranging from approximately the classical linear model (K = 1) to the nonparametric kernel regression estimator (K = n). We use mean squared error and prediction error for selecting K.
For binary responses, we extend GMR to fit nonparametric logistic regression models. Applying IPRA for each class density, we obtain two families of mixture density models. The logistic function can then be estimated by the ratio between pairs of members from each family. The result is a family of logistic models indexed by the number of mixtures in each density model. We call this procedure Gaussian Mixture Classification (GMC).
For a given GMR or GMC model, forward and backward projection algorithms are implemented to locate the optimal subspaces that minimize information loss. They serve as the model-based dimension reduction techniques for GMR and GMC.
In practice, GMR and GMC offer data analysts a systematic way to determine the appropriate level of model flexibility by choosing the number of components for modeling the underlying pdf. GMC can serve as an alternative or a complement to Mixture Discriminant Analysis (MDA). The uses of GMR and GMC are demonstrated in simulated and real data.},

A leading figure in this field, Professor Joseph Clarke has updated his book throughout to reflect these latest developments.

This thorough revision means that the book remains the key text on simulation for architects, building engineering consultants and students of building engineering and environmental design of buildings. The book's purpose is to help architects, mechanical \& environmental engineers and energy \& facility managers to understand and apply the emerging computer methods for options appraisal at the individual building, estate, city, region and national levels. This is achieved by interspersing theoretical derivations relating to simulation within an evolving description of the built environment as a complex system. The premise is that the effective application of any simulation tool requires a thorough understanding of the domain it addresses.},
